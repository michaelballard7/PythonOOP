OOP was created in 1966 by a language called SmallTalk

OOP is a paradigm for organizing and designing code

The interface is the collection of attributes and methods that other objects can use to interact with that object. 

Class : A user defined protoype for an object that defines a set of attributes and methods that characterize the data
DataMembers: Are attributes of the class, class variables instance variables and methods

Class Variables: are like global objects and shared throughout the class, they are defined within the class but outside a particular methods

Function overloading: the assignment of more than one behaviour to a function

Instance Variable: a variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class

Inheritance: the transfer of attributes and methods from one class to another

Instance: An individual object of a certain class

Instantiation: The creating of an instance of a class

Method: A special kind of function that is defined in a class


Object: A unique instance of a data structure that is defined by its class 

Operator overloading: the assignment of more than one function to an Operator.


Encapusaltion: 

Ecapsulation can be seen as the binding of data to the methods of that data.

Data hiding is a form of Encapusaltion

Interfaces and implementation are the building blocks of Ecapsulation

Interface is the fundamental means of communication between objects. This describes how users should interact with the class

Interface methods are always declared as public 

For data hiding to work all attributes should be declared as private as they are never apart of the interface

To work with attributes, getter and setter methods must be created to return attribute values

This allows the owning object to control access to its data 

Anything defined as private should be unaccessible to the user and considered apart of the classes implementation



Scoping in python follows this procedure:

1. Local
2. Enclosing
3. global
4. Built in
